# Goribby's Packs

This is a repository for my Minecraft texture packs.

Previously, the way to download them was through Mediafire, but I figured it'd be better to migrate to GitHub, that way I have some version control and there's no ads when downloading the packs.

# Downloading

You can download the packs directly from the [Releases](https://github.com/goribby/Goribbys-Packs/releases) page or from whatever platform they're on:
<br><sub>**Please note that these are the only platforms I released my packs on. If you see them anywhere else, it was uploaded without my permission.**</sub><br>

- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/goribby)
- *TODO: Add more platforms.*

# Installing

First, find your resourcepacks folder. You can do this in game by going into **Options > Resource Packs > Open Pack Folder**.

After that, just drop the .zip file into the folder and select it in game when it pops up.
